In 2020, CNN showed a heart-breaking video of a very scary thing, a polar bear searching garbage bins in Iceland for food. Their dire plight and the plight of other endangered animals is one of the many reasons We at Sterling City decided to create our App.
We want to make a difference.
We’re dedicated to conserving polar bears and the sea ice they depend on. Through media, science, and advocacy, we work to inspire people to care about the Arctic, the threats to its future, and the connection between this remote region and our global climate.

* Although our app was created for Zoologists and Scientists anyone dedicated to the preservation of animals may use the app for a fee.



* Add sketches of making the app
* step by step instructions
* backend work- our tables in db are connecting through joins and tables 

### Learn about the Development Process of our app

Our App was created to meet the needs of the hard-working scientists who do research on our planet's most precious endangered species. 
With that in mind we drafted multiple phases of this app to meet their needs:

*For PHASE 1 we wanted to address their basic needs with just creating space for quick data to be inputted.

*For PHASE 2 we responded to the initial feedback from scientists who wanted more ability to see current information about the animal in
question right away.

*For our third and final phase we took all of the requests of the scientists and created a seamless clean rollout that utilizes our advanced psql commands to generate specific data in our newly created search bar area. Users were please with the results.
